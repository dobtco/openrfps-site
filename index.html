			<h2>What it is.</h2>
			<p>
				The Open RFPs Project is modeled after Sunlight Labs' <a href='https://github.com/sunlightlabs/openstates/tree/master/openstates'>OpenStates</a>. Open RFPs collects and makes available data about contracting activities, including RFP listings as well as awards, and makes that information available in a standardized format.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="col-lg-6">
			<h2>Why we built it.</h2>
			<p>
				Because citizens have a right to know what kinds of RFPs their governments are releasing to the public, who is being awarded these contracts, and how much those projects cost.
			</p>
			<p>
				Because we want to open up the marketplace, and we believe that process starts with usability and accessibility. State procurement websites are very challenging to use by even highly computer-literate individuals, to say nothing of automating the bidding process.

			<p>
				Join us <a href='https://github.com/dobtco/openrfps'>on GitHub</a> to start writing code immediately. We've chosen Node.js because of its module-loading implementation, its accessibility to the programming community ("Everyone knows Javascript!"), and its asynchronous-by-default approach. Writing scrapers in node is a lot of fun -- take a look and give it a try.

			<p>
				Don't write code, but still eager to get involved? We'd love your help in building <a href='https://github.com/dobtco/openrfps/wiki/List-of-Procurement-Websites'>our list</a> of state procurement listing sites.
			</p>
			<p>
				We're also working to build a spec that will let governments submit a feed to their data should they choose, instead of having us scrape it from them. If this interests you, <a href='#getintouch'>get in touch</a>!
